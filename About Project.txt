D’Alexis Online Courses – Vue.js Lesson Booking App

A modern, responsive, and fully interactive lesson-booking interface built with Vue.js (v2), featuring dynamic search, sorting, cart management, form validation, and a clean UI design using pure CSS and Font Awesome icons.

📌 Project Overview

This project is a single-page Vue.js application designed for an online digital academy. It allows users to browse available lessons, search and sort courses, add items to a cart, update quantities, and complete a checkout form with validation.

The project demonstrates core front-end development skills, including:

Vue.js data binding and reactivity

Dynamic sorting & filtering

Cart state management

Form validation (name + phone)

Responsive layout using CSS Grid

Interactive UI components

Clean component-like structure inside a single HTML file

🧩 Key Features ✔ Dynamic Lesson List

Lessons are loaded from a predefined array and displayed with icons, prices, locations, and available spaces. Users can:

View and scroll through all lessons

See price and remaining spaces

Add lessons to the shopping cart

Automatically decrease available spaces

✔ Search Functionality with Debouncing

The search bar filters lessons by:

Title

Subject

Location

Price

Available spaces

To optimize performance, input is debounced for 300ms, preventing unnecessary filtering on every keystroke.

✔ Sorting System

Users can sort lessons by:

Subject

Location

Price

Spaces

Sorting order: ascending or descending

✔ Shopping Cart System

The cart supports:

Adding lessons

Removing lessons

Changing quantity

Automatic stock restoration

Displaying correct totals

Cart toggle view (Lessons ↔ Cart)

Every cart action updates Vue’s reactive state.

✔ Checkout Form + Validation

Before checkout, the user must enter:

Name → must contain only letters and spaces

Phone → must contain numbers only

A checkout button activates only when both fields are valid and the cart is not empty.

Upon success:

An order confirmation message appears

Cart and form fields reset

Message auto-clears after 7 seconds

✔ Responsive UI Design

The layout uses CSS Grid to display lessons and cart side-by-side. Below 900px, the site becomes a single-column mobile-friendly layout.
